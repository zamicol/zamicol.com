# The Information Conjecture

1. The universe is fundamentally informational.
2. Any description of a non-informational universe is informational.

Because description is fundamentally informational, we should hope for an
informational universe because if the universe is not informational there can
never be an accurate description of the universe.  If the universe is
informational, it can be fully known.  

---

The difference between an informational and non-informational universe is the
ability to know the universe.  

If the universe is non-informational, any approximation is fundamentally
informational.  An informational universe can be perfectly described, but the
description of a non-informational universe has limited resolution.  





# Hypothesis Information Razor (Ocam's Razor is wrong)
The best hypothesis is the hypothesis with the least information, not the
"simplest explanation", which is poorly definable.  

For example, tightly assuming a correlation is more information than assuming an
unknown correlation. Since assuming an unknown correlation is less information,
it is the better hypothesis ceteris paribus.  However, tightly assuming a
correlation is widely considered the "simplest" explanation.  











# Quantum
- Bit is the quantum of information.
- Thread is the quantum of fabric.  
- Word is the quantum of language. 
- Letter is the quantum of word.  
- Idea is the quantum of thought. 
- Gene is the quantum of genetics.
- Meme is the quantum of culture.
- Action is the quantum of state change.
- State change is the quantum of time.  

- A coze is the quantum of authentication.  

# Computer Science Words
- Computerware, (computware)
  Noun. All hardware, software, and data components of a computer system. 
Example: The StrawRaspBanBerry mini computer is a fully open source device as all computers are under a GPL 2.0 license.
- Computerware succession
Novel computerware is usually closed source and propriety, but overtime subsitutes becomes more available as open source and at a lower price.  

- Onion Complexity Principle
Organize applications modularly to allow importing of levels of complexity.  
Individual  
The smallest unit of computerware operating before reinterpreting inputs from other distinct networked computerware.
Individuals grow  in total ability as it consumes other systems.  
Individuals arise due to computational and network bandwidth dynamics.  
A network with perfect computation and bandwidth will result in one individual.  
As computerware advances, abstracted components grow in complexity.  This growth gives the need for individuals to create others. 
Loosely coupled computer systems result in more individuals, tightly coupled results in fewer.  
Datastructure
Instead of data structure.  
Vestigial Code
Code or code architecture that use to serve a that us


# Work

If your manager has no technical ability, they are a bad manager.  

A managers merit must first be measuered by their technical knowledge and then secondly their managerial skills. 



# Javascript
Javascript's design can be summarized simply:

Someone once did something wrong, and now it's apart of the language, so everyone has to deal with it forever.   

"Why is this thing this that way?"  Someone once wrote the code wrong so now it's eternally the wrong thing.
