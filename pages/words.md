# The Information Conjecture

1. The universe is fundamentally informational.
2. Any description of a non-informational universe is informational.

If the universe is non-informational, any approximation is fundamentally
informational.  An informational universe can be perfectly described, but the
description of a non-informational universe will have limited resolution.  

Because description is fundamentally informational, we should hope for an
informational universe because if it's not there can never be an accurate
description of the universe.  If the universe is informational, it can be fully
known.  

The difference between an informational and non-informational universe is the
ability to know the universe.  


# Quantum
- Bit is the quantum of information.
- Thread is the quantum of fabric.  
- Word is the quantum of language. 
- Letter is the quantum of word.  
- Idea is the quantum of thought. 
- Gene is the quantum of genetics.
- Meme is the quantum of culture.
- Action is the quantum of state change.
- State change is the quantum of time.  

- A coze is the quantum of authentication.  

# Computer Science Words
- Computerware, (computware)
  Noun. All hardware, software, and data components of a computer system. 
Example: The StrawRaspBanBerry mini computer is a fully open source device as all computers are under a GPL 2.0 license.
- Computerware succession
Novel computerware is usually closed source and propriety, but overtime subsitutes becomes more available as open source and at a lower price.  

- Onion Complexity Principle
Organize applications modularly to allow importing of levels of complexity.  
Individual  
The smallest unit of computerware operating before reinterpreting inputs from other distinct networked computerware.
Individuals grow  in total ability as it consumes other systems.  
Individuals arise due to computational and network bandwidth dynamics.  
A network with perfect computation and bandwidth will result in one individual.  
As computerware advances, abstracted components grow in complexity.  This growth gives the need for individuals to create others. 
Loosely coupled computer systems result in more individuals, tightly coupled results in fewer.  
Datastructure
Instead of data structure.  
Vestigial Code
Code or code architecture that use to serve a that us
