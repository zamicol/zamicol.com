# Concepts
Cyclomatic complexity - a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a
program. 

Pigeonhole principle - In the domain of compression the pigeonhole
principle states that for all compression algorithms, some outputs will be
*larger* than the inputs. 

euphemism treadmill   - euphemisms themselves become
taboo words, so new ones are needed.  People that don't rage against this
ridiculousness are dumb and generally uninteresting.  

Late stage bureaucracy.  (Alternatively late state bureaucracy, a A double entendre)
A political philosophy marked by anti-liberty, anti-meritocratic, anti-rule of
(simple) law, anti-individual/minority rights, and pro-government control,
pro-tyranny-of-the-majority, pro-war.  
🫣 Late stage capitalism?  
🫵 Late state bureaucracy.

Toxic Compassion is the prioritization of short term emotional comfort over
long-term outcomes




# Zami Words

convolutional collapse - The quick connecting of perviously not-tightly
networked concepts due to a new understanding.  
Quick understanding, when a long series of concepts are networked together and
things "make sense".   Like dominos finally falling, or a bolt of lightning.  

Vicarious Ego 
~2012 (Mom invented term)
 - Soccer dads that get too invested beacuase they are living sports through their child.  

Computerware 
~2014 
All hardware and software components of a computer system.
The StrawRaspBananaBerry pie mini computer is a fully open source device as all computerware is under a GPL 2.0 license.


expolog (expologic, expoligically)
~ 2023
Expolog is the exclusive hypernym of exponential and logarithmic and hyponym of Transcendental.  


## Possible, Plausible, Probable, Feasible
Possible: Has the ability to be real under real conditions, regardless of how novel or mundane.

Plausible: Has the ability to be a solution under a given condition, current ability, or normal conditions.

Probable: A likely outcome with given or normal conditions.

Feasible: Under given conditions, likely to be possible without excessive or unforeseen effort.

"It's possible the engineer will report building the longer bridge is plausible, and it's probable the feds will issue a grant making its construction feasible".



Pareto principle: The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few")




# Political Words
wokesplainin - This word resembles a contraction but lacks an apostrophe thus poking fun at the cultistis general unawareness of correct English.
Bigoteering -  The act of labeling a person “racist”, “sexist”, or somethinglikeit-ist in situations where these are not warranted, in an attempt to exploit the stigmas accompanying such labels and force the opponent to spend time and energy explaining “why he/she is not a bigot”.
If you disagree with Sally on anything political, all she does is call you a sexist, racist, homophobe. Classic bigoteering.
Urban Monoculture - The worldwide woke, anti-truth, and low birthrate urban culture.  
AWFUL: Affluent White Female Urban Liberals

## Wokeness Definition of Woke
Woke: Wokeness, also termed the "woke mind virus", is a political strategy and
culture that's chiefly characterized by the rejection of personal responsibility
and merit, and embrace of victimhood identity. Woke has an external locus of
control and rejects the existence of an internal locus of control.

The woke dogma is that all inequality in the world comes from oppression.
Therefore, some groups don't succeed because of inequality.  


Wokeness quickly asserts blame to others instead of assigning blame
correctly to originating groups as a means to reject merit.   Wokeness rejects
meritocracy and advocates for kakistocracy.  Outsiders frequently view wokeness
as weak willed, ignorant, undeservingly entitled, and highly destructive. 

Wokeness believes in monoculture, cult adherence to group dogma, and does not
value diversity.  Adherence to cult dogma is ironically termed "diversity".
Wokeness labels views outside of their cult dogma as "bad" and only views
originating from within the  group as "good".  Wokeness ostracizes independent
thinkers to preserving an echo chamber.  

Wokeness rejects equality under the law and believes in giving certain ethnic
groups governmentally institutionalized privilege over other groups.  In place
of diversity, wokeness favors "equality through oppression" and advocates for a
society structured as described by the 1961 "Harrison Bergeron".

Woke believes that any group that is succeeding, like European men or Jews, are
oppressors.  The Wokeness cult elevates any group that is perceived by the
narrative as a victim. Woke believes in European cultural genocide.  

Wokeness is frequently characterized by newspeak, suppression of facts, and
hatred of free speech.  Wokeness seeks to establish a censorship apparatus to
eliminate any thought that contradicts the woke hive mind.  

Wokeness does not believe in the rule of law, rather the rule of mob and
kakistocracy.  

Wokeness frequently accompanies the rejection of heritage and tradition for the
sake of being edgy and rebellious, self inflicting harm, refusal to look at
data.Wokeness looks down on women who choose to marry and have families and
instead exults childlessness.  

Instead of working in their own communities toward excellence, wokeness aims to
destroy the American productive class to bring them down to the perceived levels
of failing groups.

Wokeness ignores or minimizes data that is inconvenient, but magnifies data that
the woke hive mind thinks advances their dogma.  Wokeness lacks a
backpropagation algorithm.  If the same data is later inconvenient, instead of
updating assumptions, wokeness favors "forgetting" data they used to advocate.  

Wokeness ignores racial crime data in the USA.  

The opposite of wokeness is liberty.  Liberty believes that regardless of where
someone starts, all should use their own internal power, a natural right that
cannot be taken or given by government, to advance and better themselves.
