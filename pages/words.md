insularly - The ethno-cult worked insularly against the interests of the larger society. 
incomputable - Turing showed that some problems are incomputable.
doctrinally - What **IS** big is the rhetoric that the Bible has been translated "over and over again", which is just simply not true.  This falsehood has been taught by Mormons, doctrinally, for generations.  Modern translation are trustworthy, for the same logical reasons that we can trust genetics. (Biblical textual criticism is the academic precursor to genetics.) Also, when translators have doubt, they're really good about leaving footnotes.  Also, the oldest copy of the so-called "Hebrew Bible" is in **Greek** not Hebrew.  The entirety of the New Testament is in Greek.
preestablished, pre-established - (First form is preferred): For Coze's integrity checking to be useful, key trust must be preestablished.
decameter, hectometer, megameter, decimeter, - This is how retarded SI is, Google spellcheck doesn't even know the first units!!!!!  GAWD THIS IS RETARDED!
Masoretic - The Greek Septuagint far predats the Hebrew Masoretic.  The oldest copy we have of the old testament, by far, is in Greek, not Hebrew.Yes, this is true even for Talmudic Jews: Their oldest copy of their own texts is written in Greek, not Hebrew. Further, even the Jewish holy book, the Talmud itself, is primarily in Aramaic, not Hebrew. Yes, this is true even for Talmudic Jews: Their oldest copy of their own texts is written in Greek, not Hebrew.

# Zami Words

## convolutional collapse
The quick connecting of perviously not-tightly
networked concepts due to a new understanding.  
Quick understanding, when a long series of concepts are networked together and
things "make sense".   Like dominos finally falling, or a bolt of lightning.  

## Vicarious Ego
~2012 (Mom invented term)
 - Soccer dads that get too invested beacuase they are living sports through their child.  

## Computerware 
~2014 
All hardware and software components of a computer system.
The StrawRaspBananaBerry pie mini computer is a fully open source device as all computerware is under a GPL 2.0 license.

## Masterbet
March 2020
"Master Alphabet"  A master alphabet that's useful for truncation for smaller bases.  Yes, it's tounge-in-cheek


## expolog (expologic, expoligically)
~ 2023
Expolog is the exclusive hypernym of exponential and logarithmic and hyponym of Transcendental.  

Expologic functions are increasingly divergent from polynomial functions.  See complaint about physicists and mathematicians on "dopplershift".  

## cyphary (base 0) (cypherary)
May 10, 2024
The concept of a number base is defined as the number of unique digits used to
represent a number in a positional numeral system. 

The smallest base traditionally used used is base 1 (unary), which uses only one digit (usually 1) to represent all
numbers. In a positional numeral system, each digit is multiplied by the base
raised to a power determined by its position. 


For example, in base 10 (decimal),
the number 123 is calculated as follows: 1 * 10^2 + 2 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^0 = 100 +
20 + 3 = 123 If we were to consider a hypothetical "base 0" system, any number
raised to the power of 0 would always equal 1 (except for 0^0, which is
undefined).

But number systems don't start at unary, they start at cyphary (base 0), and informationally it's important to explain what cyphary is, because cyphary better explains what entropy is.  

Unary is interesting by by base 2+ standards, because it's incapable of generating entropy. A single sided dice can only tell you how many times it was rolled; it does not produce any new information.  

A two sided dice, that is a base 2 dice, tells you how many times it was rolled and a new bit of information.  "New bit of information" is entropy.  

Base 1 (unary) is interesting from base 0's perspective because it's capable of representing information.  Base 0 can tell you nothing.  It's "undefined".  It's literally no information.  

A zero sided dice doesn't exist.  There's no ability to learn anything, not even a single bit of information, from a zero sided dice.  Base 0 is the non-transmittal of information.  

I've been pronouncing it both ways, cyphary and cypherary.  I think cyphary is better because it follows the existing pattern: cyph-ary, un-ary, bi-nary, tern-ary.  It's also funny that it looks like "Zachary", I keep on thinking I'm seeing my name. 


## cypharions 
August 8, 2025
A zero dimensional number

Cypharions - Complexics of zero dimension. 
Unarions - Complexics of one dimension. When n=0 it results in the real numbers since 2^0 = 1. 
Binarions - Complexics of two dimensions. When n=1, 2^1 = 2. 
Quaternions, Octonion, Sedenion, etc.

## sanctimoniac 
2024/06/09
A person characterized by or prone to excessive or hypocritical displays of sanctimony; someone who frequently adopts a holier-than-thou attitude, self-righteousness, or moral superiority.



## Despostatist 
2024/7/11
Also "dictastatist", "desponationalist", "dictanational"

George Orwell said, "As used, the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless. ...  almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for  'Fascist.'"

Just because Benito Mussolini used propaganda to pervert a word to add a positive spin to his despotism doesn't mean we should allow him to pervert that word.

He was a despot.  He must be resisted.  

Reasonable historians and journalism can do much better safeguarding language.  Engineers shouldn't have to clean up their mess.  We're not the ones with degrees in English.  


## Complexics 2025/1/13
Complexics (n.): The family of number systems that follow the Cayley-Dickson construction, starting with complex numbers, continuing through quaternions, octonions, and all subsequent powers of two constructions but excludes other hypercomplex numbers.


Scope limited hypernym for complex numbers and higher dimensional complex numbers, quaternions, octonions, sedenions, and the doublings beyond.  See my blog, "How Information Theory Explains Why Complex Numbers Don't Have a Third Dimension."  I considered using "Complexoids".  

## Binions and Unions 2025/1/22 - ish

Following "quaternions" and "octonions", imaginary numbers should be called "binions", and in this context, the reals are "unarions" .  The reals are "single dimensional numbers", the bionions are "two dimensional numbers".  

(I wanted YOO-nee-unz, "unions" but the spelling already exists (like work "unions"). Instead of other silly spellings, unnions is stealing the first syllable sound but the first and second syllable spelling, bad practice. Unyons would be better, but breaks the pattern. 

I wanted "YOO-nee-unz", "unions", but it's a spelling for too common of a word.  Unnions takes the first syllable sound but the first and second spelling, bad practice.  Other spellings break the pattern, thus unarions is the winner, keeps the pattern, clear, more expressive at the cost of a syllable.  I consider the tradeoff with being more expressive acceptable.

## Turing Fungible 2025/01/13
A process that can run on a Turing machine can run on any Turing machine.  That process is Turing fungible.  Any process that can run on a Turing complete machine is Turing fungible.

## decitrillionaires, hectobillionaires 2025/04/16 

I've been hearing people call Elon and others "centibillionaires".  

They are decitrillionaires or hectobillionaires. "Centibillionaire" is going the wrong direction.

Another example of the SI system being anti-ergonomic.



## cognitive empathy and emotive empathy(sometime in 2024)

Emotive Empathy: The ability to feel and share another person's emotions,
experiencing their emotional state as if it were one's own. It involves an
emotional resonance or connection, often leading to a visceral sense of what the
other person is feeling.

Cognitive Empathy: The ability to understand and model another person's mental
state, perspective, or thought processes logically, explicitly excluding any
emotional involvement or influence.

Many people have no concept that cognitive empathy exists.  Their understanding
of empathy is solely emotive.  They have no comception that people model the
mental state of others to better understand their perspective.

The thing that cognitive modelers quickly discover is that many people have
**no** mental process.  They are merely emotional beings, acting solely in the
moment, based on how they feel.  That's why they have no concept of a mental
process.  The idea of systematically and quantitatively evaluation a situation
befor making dicisions is a foreign concept.

When they meet cognitive modelers, it's like meeting an alien.  The results of
their careful and stratigic actions seem like magic.  

Cognitive empathy" is the name for modeling the mental, logical process, not
feelings or emotion. I've been enumerating the distinction using "emotive
empathy" as its counterpart.


## Soharan 
(Sometime in 2023) 
Someone from or with ancestry from Sub-Saharan Africa.  It means "Sub-Saharans",
however, since it will almost certinaly "sub" will eventually be politically
criticized, "Soharan" is a pormantue of "South of the Sahara", "Soharan".

African used to mean "Sub-Saharan", especially based on context.  However,
Americans are dumber than ever so a more precise word is required. 

I also suggest  "soharia" over "sub-saharia".

## Cat in the Hat Engineering
### Zamicol, 20250501  
A flawed engineering and project management strategy wherein unresolved issues or poor designs within a project prompt an expansion of scope, generating additional problems and increasing technical debt. This approach, rather than resolving issues through a correct and well-considered initial design, creates a complex web of issues, often manifesting as spaghetti code tentacles that cause widespread complications.

Some organizations are managerially incentivized to embrace Cat in the Hat Engineering, as it provides busy work that creates an appearance of productivity without effectively accomplishing meaningful goals. 

Named after Dr. Seuss’s The Cat in the Hat Comes Back, where the Cat, unable to resolve an initial mess, creates further troubles by displacing the problem elsewhere. 

JavaScript frequently exemplifies this phenomenon, as efforts to address its original shortcomings spiraled into broader, more intricate problems across its ecosystem, which could have been avoided with simpler existing technologies or better initial design.  

Originally stated: “Can’t fix problems in a project? Increase the scope to make more problems elsewhere. Soon tentacles emerge, everything has problems, and your project doesn’t look as relatively bad.” (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43852162#43855415)

Cat in the Hat Engineering and Iatrogenic Engineering

Ken Thompson and Rob Pike knew that VOOM was the answer to UTF-16.  

## Iatrogenic Engineering
### qbit and nrdxp, 20250926  

A problematic engineering process wherein humanity develops a technology or system that inadvertently generates significant issues, prompting a cycle of further interventions to address the problems caused by the original creation. This results in increasing complications that could have been avoided by forgoing the problematic technology entirely and adopting existing, more effective substitutes. 

The term encapsulates the spiraling consequences of attempting to resolve issues caused by a technology that should not have existed in the first place. 

UTF-16 exemplifies iatrodysgenic engineering, as its adoption introduced persistent issues that required ongoing fixes, unnecessarily complicating systems when existing alternatives would have sufficed; it is a technology that should never have been created.  

Originally stated: “Humanity creates something that causes problems .. then spirals out trying to fix problems created by the thing in the first place.”

## Cat in the Hat Engineering and Iatrogenic Engineering
In both Cat in the Hat Engineering and Iatrogenic Engineering, the complexity arising from over-engineering can be avoided by prioritizing existing technologies or solutions and focusing on robust initial designs. This approach minimizes technical debt, prevents cascading issues, and eliminates the need for superficially productive but ultimately ineffective engineering efforts.

Stochastic terrorism: Agents in power allowing existing danger to grow and doing less than required to stop the violence.  

Stochastic terrorism is taking advantage of latent violence to accomplish goals.
Purposing acting, including through attrition or acts of omission, in a way that
enables latent violence to be more successful is stochastic terrorism.  .
For example, Team blue took advantage of stochastic terrorism by not reporting
that a conference attendy had a gun.  They also didn't have enough people
manning the metal detectors and knew with statistical certainty eventually a nut
job would slip in.

## Possible, Plausible, Probable, Feasible
Possible: Has the ability to be real under real conditions, regardless of how novel or mundane.

Plausible: Has the ability to be a solution under a given condition, current ability, or normal conditions.

Probable: A likely outcome with given or normal conditions.

Feasible: Under given conditions, likely to be possible without excessive or unforeseen effort.

Able to be competitive.  


























# FIX ENGLISH, GAWD DAMN!
## Fixing the ridiculous spellings in the English Language. 

I'm 110% for getting rid of **all written English language** and starting over with a better, consonate based alphabet.  
In lieu of that, here's some fixes of a written language that desperately needs it.  


## Filipino/Philippines
It should either be "The Felipines" or the demonym should be "Philipino".  

Using a Greek root (Philippus) for a Spanish name (Felipe) is silly, causing two issues: the Ph/F and the p/pp.  Filipino is the most correct, so it should be the Felipines or Filipines.


# ACTION (in physics)
Computation is the result of intentional state change. State change in such context is correctly named "action". Although the polysemous "action" is overloaded in physics, this is the most correct context for the word.


# "Yours" and "Ours" need apostrophes
"Is that your's? No, it's our's."

# Gotten vs Got
I like gotten better, just like oxen.




















# Political Words
wokesplainin - This word resembles a contraction but lacks an apostrophe thus poking fun at the cultistis general unawareness of correct English.
Bigoteering -  The act of labeling a person “racist”, “sexist”, or somethinglikeit-ist in situations where these are not warranted, in an attempt to exploit the stigmas accompanying such labels and force the opponent to spend time and energy explaining “why he/she is not a bigot”.
If you disagree with Sally on anything political, all she does is call you a sexist, racist, homophobe. Classic bigoteering.
Urban Monoculture - The worldwide woke, anti-truth, and low birthrate urban culture.

## Wokeness Definition of Woke
Woke:  A political strategy and culture that's chiefly characterized by the
rejection of personal responsibility and merit and embrace of victimhood
identity. Wokness is justified by the dogma that all moral failure originates
from oppression and rejects an internal locus of control.


Therefore, some groups don't succeed because of inequality.

Wokeness, also termed the "woke mind virus",

Woke has an external locus of
control and rejects the existence of an internal locus of control.

The woke dogma is that all inequality in the world comes from oppression.
Therefore, some groups don't succeed because of inequality.


Wokeness quickly asserts blame to others instead of assigning blame
correctly to originating groups as a means to reject merit.   Wokeness rejects
meritocracy and advocates for kakistocracy.  Outsiders frequently view wokeness
as weak willed, ignorant, undeservingly entitled, and highly destructive. 

Wokeness believes in monoculture, cult adherence to group dogma, and does not
value diversity.  Adherence to cult dogma is ironically termed "diversity".
Wokeness labels views outside of their cult dogma as "bad" and only views
originating from within the  group as "good".  Wokeness ostracizes independent
thinkers to preserving an echo chamber.  

Wokeness rejects equality under the law and believes in giving certain ethnic
groups governmentally institutionalized privilege over other groups.  In place
of diversity, wokeness favors "equality through oppression" and advocates for a
society structured as described by the 1961 "Harrison Bergeron".

Woke believes that any group that is succeeding, like European men or Jews, are
oppressors.  The Wokeness cult elevates any group that is perceived by the
narrative as a victim. Woke believes in European cultural genocide.  

Wokeness is frequently characterized by newspeak, suppression of facts, and
hatred of free speech.  Wokeness seeks to establish a censorship apparatus to
eliminate any thought that contradicts the woke hive mind.  

Wokeness does not believe in the rule of law, rather the rule of mob and
kakistocracy.  

Wokeness frequently accompanies the rejection of heritage and tradition for the
sake of being edgy and rebellious, self inflicting harm, refusal to look at
data.Wokeness looks down on women who choose to marry and have families and
instead exults childlessness.  

Instead of working in their own communities toward excellence, wokeness aims to
destroy the American productive class to bring them down to the perceived levels
of failing groups.

Wokeness ignores or minimizes data that is inconvenient, but magnifies data that
the woke hive mind thinks advances their dogma.  Wokeness lacks a
backpropagation algorithm.  If the same data is later inconvenient, instead of
updating assumptions, wokeness favors "forgetting" data they used to advocate.  

Wokeness ignores racial crime data in the USA.  

The opposite of wokeness is liberty.  Liberty believes that regardless of where
someone starts, all should use their own internal power, a natural right that
cannot be taken or given by government, to advance and better themselves.
