Stochastic terrorism: Agents in power allowing existing danger to grow and doing less than required to stop the violence.  

Stochastic terrorism is taking advantage of latent violence to accomplish goals.
Purposing acting, including through attrition or acts of omission, in a way that
enables latent violence to be more successful is stochastic terrorism.  .
For example, Team blue took advantage of stochastic terrorism by not reporting
that a conference attendy had a gun.  They also didn't have enough people
manning the metal detectors and knew with statistical certainty eventually a nut
job would slip in.  



# Concepts
Cyclomatic complexity - a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a
program. 

Pigeonhole principle - In the domain of compression the pigeonhole
principle states that for all compression algorithms, some outputs will be
*larger* than the inputs. 

euphemism treadmill   - euphemisms themselves become
taboo words, so new ones are needed.  People that don't rage against this
ridiculousness are dumb and generally uninteresting.  

Late stage bureaucracy.  (Alternatively late state bureaucracy, a A double entendre)
A political philosophy marked by anti-liberty, anti-meritocratic, anti-rule of
(simple) law, anti-individual/minority rights, and pro-government control,
pro-tyranny-of-the-majority, pro-war.  
🫣 Late stage capitalism?  
🫵 Late state bureaucracy.

Toxic Compassion is the prioritization of short term emotional comfort over
long-term outcomes

## expolog (expologic, expoligically)
~ 2023
Expolog is the exclusive hypernym of exponential and logarithmic and hyponym of Transcendental.  

Expologic functions are increasingly divergent from polynomial functions.  See complaint about physicists and mathematicians on "dopplershift".  

## cyphary (base 0)
May 10, 2024
The concept of a number base is defined as the number of unique digits used to
represent a number in a positional numeral system. 

The smallest base traditionally used used is base 1 (unary), which uses only one digit (usually 1) to represent all
numbers. In a positional numeral system, each digit is multiplied by the base
raised to a power determined by its position. 


For example, in base 10 (decimal),
the number 123 is calculated as follows: 1 * 10^2 + 2 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^0 = 100 +
20 + 3 = 123 If we were to consider a hypothetical "base 0" system, any number
raised to the power of 0 would always equal 1 (except for 0^0, which is
undefined).

But number systems don't start at unary, they start at cyphary (base 0), and informationally it's important to explain what cyphary is, because cyphary better explains what entropy is.  

Unary is interesting by by base 2+ standards, because it's incapable of generating entropy. A single sided dice can only tell you how many times it was rolled; it does not produce any new information.  

A two sided dice, that is a base 2 dice, tells you how many times it was rolled and a new bit of information.  "New bit of information" is entropy.  

Base 1 (unary) is interesting from base 0's perspective because it's capable of representing information.  Base 0 can tell you nothing.  It's "undefined".  It's literally no information.  

A zero sided dice doesn't exist.  There's no ability to learn anything, not even a single bit of information, from a zero sided dice.  Base 0 is the non-transmittal of information.  


## sanctimoniac 2024/06/09
A person characterized by or prone to excessive or hypocritical displays of sanctimony; someone who frequently adopts a holier-than-thou attitude, self-righteousness, or moral superiority.



# Despostatist 2024/7/11
Also "dictastatist", "desponationalist", "dictanational"

George Orwell said, "As used, the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless. ...  almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for  'Fascist.'"

Just because Benito Mussolini used propaganda to pervert a word to add a positive spin to his despotism doesn't mean we should allow him to pervert that word.

He was a despot.  He must be resisted.  

Reasonable historians and journalism can do much better safeguarding language.  Engineers shouldn't have to clean up their mess.  We're not the ones with degrees in English.  


# Complexics 2025/1/13
Complexics (n.): The family of number systems that follow the Cayley-Dickson construction, starting with complex numbers, continuing through quaternions, octonions, and all subsequent powers of two constructions but excludes other hypercomplex numbers.


Scope limited hypernym for complex numbers and higher dimensional complex numbers, quaternions, octonions, sedenions, and the doublings beyond.  See my blog, "How Information Theory Explains Why Complex Numbers Don't Have a Third Dimension."  I considered using "Complexoids".  























# Fun with Words.  



## Possible, Plausible, Probable, Feasible
Possible: Has the ability to be real under real conditions, regardless of how novel or mundane.

Plausible: Has the ability to be a solution under a given condition, current ability, or normal conditions.

Probable: A likely outcome with given or normal conditions.

Feasible: Under given conditions, likely to be possible without excessive or unforeseen effort.

"It's possible the engineer will report building the longer bridge is plausible, and it's probable the feds will issue a grant making its construction feasible".



Pareto principle: The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few")




# Political Words
wokesplainin - This word resembles a contraction but lacks an apostrophe thus poking fun at the cultistis general unawareness of correct English.
Bigoteering -  The act of labeling a person “racist”, “sexist”, or somethinglikeit-ist in situations where these are not warranted, in an attempt to exploit the stigmas accompanying such labels and force the opponent to spend time and energy explaining “why he/she is not a bigot”.
If you disagree with Sally on anything political, all she does is call you a sexist, racist, homophobe. Classic bigoteering.
Urban Monoculture - The worldwide woke, anti-truth, and low birthrate urban culture.  
AWFUL: Affluent White Female Urban Liberals

## Wokeness Definition of Woke
Woke: Wokeness, also termed the "woke mind virus", is a political strategy and
culture that's chiefly characterized by the rejection of personal responsibility
and merit, and embrace of victimhood identity. Woke has an external locus of
control and rejects the existence of an internal locus of control.

The woke dogma is that all inequality in the world comes from oppression.
Therefore, some groups don't succeed because of inequality.  


Wokeness quickly asserts blame to others instead of assigning blame
correctly to originating groups as a means to reject merit.   Wokeness rejects
meritocracy and advocates for kakistocracy.  Outsiders frequently view wokeness
as weak willed, ignorant, undeservingly entitled, and highly destructive. 

Wokeness believes in monoculture, cult adherence to group dogma, and does not
value diversity.  Adherence to cult dogma is ironically termed "diversity".
Wokeness labels views outside of their cult dogma as "bad" and only views
originating from within the  group as "good".  Wokeness ostracizes independent
thinkers to preserving an echo chamber.  

Wokeness rejects equality under the law and believes in giving certain ethnic
groups governmentally institutionalized privilege over other groups.  In place
of diversity, wokeness favors "equality through oppression" and advocates for a
society structured as described by the 1961 "Harrison Bergeron".

Woke believes that any group that is succeeding, like European men or Jews, are
oppressors.  The Wokeness cult elevates any group that is perceived by the
narrative as a victim. Woke believes in European cultural genocide.  

Wokeness is frequently characterized by newspeak, suppression of facts, and
hatred of free speech.  Wokeness seeks to establish a censorship apparatus to
eliminate any thought that contradicts the woke hive mind.  

Wokeness does not believe in the rule of law, rather the rule of mob and
kakistocracy.  

Wokeness frequently accompanies the rejection of heritage and tradition for the
sake of being edgy and rebellious, self inflicting harm, refusal to look at
data.Wokeness looks down on women who choose to marry and have families and
instead exults childlessness.  

Instead of working in their own communities toward excellence, wokeness aims to
destroy the American productive class to bring them down to the perceived levels
of failing groups.

Wokeness ignores or minimizes data that is inconvenient, but magnifies data that
the woke hive mind thinks advances their dogma.  Wokeness lacks a
backpropagation algorithm.  If the same data is later inconvenient, instead of
updating assumptions, wokeness favors "forgetting" data they used to advocate.  

Wokeness ignores racial crime data in the USA.  

The opposite of wokeness is liberty.  Liberty believes that regardless of where
someone starts, all should use their own internal power, a natural right that
cannot be taken or given by government, to advance and better themselves.
