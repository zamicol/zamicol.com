# Public Words that I like
juristic
perturbation
misanthropic - disliking humankind and avoiding human society.
adduce - cite as exidence 
germane - Relevant or foundational to an area of study.  

# Concepts
Cyclomatic complexity - a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a program.
Pigeonhole principle - In the domain of compression the pigeonhole principle states that for all compression algorithms, some outputs will be *larger* than the inputs.
euphemism treadmill   - euphemisms themselves become taboo words, so new ones are needed.  People that don't rage against this ridiculousness are dumb and generally uninteresting.  




# Zami Words
Possible, Plausible, Probable, Feasible
Possible: Has the ability to be real under real conditions, regardless of how novel or mundane.

Plausible: Has the ability to be a solution under a given condition, current ability, or normal conditions.

Probable: A likely outcome with given or normal conditions.

Feasible: Under given conditions, likely to be possible without excessive or unforeseen effort.

"It's possible the engineer will report building the longer bridge is plausible, and it's probable the feds will issue a grant making its construction feasible".


# Political Words
wokesplainin - This word resembles a contraction but lacks an apostrophe thus poking fun at the cultistis general unawareness of correct English.
