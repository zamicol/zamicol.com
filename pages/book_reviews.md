A Mind at Play How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age 
Good book, 90/100.  Quick overview of Shannon's life.  Playful and entertaining.

I'm currently reading Human Diversity by Charles Murray.  @charlesmurray
 
Excellent, highly quantitative, fire hose of information.  I'm only to chapter 5, but so far it's been eye opening.

95/100
