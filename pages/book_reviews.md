Good book, 90/100.  Quick overview of Shannon's life.  Playful and entertaining.

Excellent, highly quantitative, fire hose of information.  I'm only to chapter 5, but so far it's been eye opening.

Later: Finished the book.  The later chapters were not as hard hitting as the earlier chapters, but overall an excellent book.  Every voting American should read this book.  

95/100
