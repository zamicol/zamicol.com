			<h4> Interesting happenings</h4>
			<br>- The first peice of sotware I wrote for the State of Colorado while still at university. It "householded" mailings for Colorado governments and likely saved Colorado close to a million dollar in postage in the first year. Software I've written helps mail me my property taxes each year.
			<br>- Submitted the QR patent 11580064 covering BASE45 before the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9285/">Base45 RFC</a> was published.
			<br>- Found a bug in Go's crypto packages where key comparison was not constant time.
			<br>- Found a 10+ year old bug with Go's ASCII/UTF-8 representation. The Go authors are the authors of UTF-8, making finding a bug unlikely.
			<br>- Had one of the first Mt. Gox accounts. Personally messaged many of the early Bitcoiners. Magical Tux convinced me to learn PHP which I then wrote some State of Colorado systems.
			<br>- I had a T-Shirt design from my T-Shirt shop appear on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws8_u2do3o4">NBC/ABC nightly news</a> with a story about how quickly the designs appeared online after their story. I worked on a design overnight, based on one of their stories, and they showed it the next day.
			<br>- I wrote the TV scheduling system, in Go, likely still being used by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBCMq0egjfA">Comcast based on SCTE 224</a>. It helped Comcast moved from satellite system to terrestrial TCP/IP. It is used by Comcast, ESPN, Disney, and others.

Space is light.
Action, that is state change, results in new information, entropy.
To preserve information, action produces new particles while conserving overall energy.
This is the trick: More information can be encoded by more particles, while the sum of energy, the overall energy, remains constant.
This is why action must produce light.
New light is new space.
Gravity is caused by action, not directly by mass.
Space isn't curved, rather it has varying density, caused by action. (Space having varying density, in of itself, doesn't change the mathematics of GR, just the interpretation thereof.)
A snapshot of a closed system can perfectly recreate its past; Time can be played in reverse if given all particles from a closed system.
In this way, action causes the expansion of the universe. Time causes the expansion of the Universe.
In this way, time also causes the cooling of the universe, a lower average energy per particle as more particles are created.
These truths give us this equation: g′=γg.
g′=γg is missing first from Special Relativity, and consequently from General Relativity's calculations
GR currently has overqualified assumptions. g′=γg is a less entropic assumption than GR's current assumptions. 
Informationally, g′=γg is a less entropic assumption (an informational version of Occam's Razor).  GR is informationally more complex than the simpler assumption, g′=γg.


The Luminiferous Aether is real.
Light is a particle, space is the wave just as a water molecule is a particle, the ocean carries waves.
The stream of discrete actions is perceived as continuous time.
The expansion of the universe is caused by action; The accelerating expansion of space is caused by the Landauer limit.
Quantum action is deterministic. God doesn't play dice; entropy is precious and expensive.
All information is preserved. Information is created, mutated, but never destroyed.
Everything is remembered, eternally.


Gravity wells are sombreros.
Black holes directly emit light (consequence of g′=γg)
Apparent black hole event horizons are relative. The closer to a black hole the smaller they appear. 
The more time dilated an observer, the smaller the horizon appears until it vanishes.
Space is dynamic, not static. Since space is light, space itself moves at the speed of light.
Because of this, the Beckenstein bound is the information transfer limit from one area of the universe to another.
The information conveyable by a photon is relative to the observer.  Blue shift, higher information, red shift, lower information.
Galaxies spin fast because of gravitational lensing. Dark energy isn't needed; solved by Alexandre Deur 20 years ago, "Relativistic corrections to the rotation curves of disk galaxies"
The Bullet Cluster is likely proof of action causing gravity.
The cosmological constant was indeed Einstein's biggest blunder.
The Hubble "constant" doesn't exist.  (The Landauer Limit does.)
Singularities only exist in mathematics, not physical reality.
Cosmological redshift lacks mechanics, but it isn't real anyway. Redshift is caused by time dilation or velocity, which share a root cause.
